Q1: What is Linear Regression?

A: Linear Regression is a staitistical technique used 
to predict the value of a dependent variable based on 
the values of one or more independent variables. 
It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

the equation is y^ =X⋅θ 

y^ is the predicted value of the dependent variable
X is the matrix of independent variables
θ is the vector of coefficients


Q2: What is Mean Squared Error (MSE)?

A: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of the 
average squared difference between the predicted    
values and the actual values of a dependent variable.

The equation is MSE = 1/2n⋅∑(y^i-yi)^2

Where :

y^ is the predicted value of the dependent variables
y is the actual value of the dependent variables
n is the number of observations
i is the index of the observation


Q3: What is Gradient Descent?

A: Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used 
to find the minimum value of a function by iteratively 
adjusting the parameters of a model.


The equation is θ =θ−α⋅∇J(θ)

Where:

θ is the vector of coefficients
α is the learning rate
J is the cost function




How the code well works?

1- linear Regression use to predict output value using input value

2- Mean Squared Error is  Measure how far the predictions are from the true values. 

2- Gradient Descent is : Update the parameters θ to reduce the cost.
